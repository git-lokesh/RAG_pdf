# Local PDF RAG Chat (Streamlit + Ollama)

This project lets you chat with the content of your PDF files using a fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
Everything runs on your machine using Ollama, FAISS, and Streamlit.

## Features:
- Extract text from uploaded PDF documents.
- Split text into overlapping chunks for better retrieval.
- Build a FAISS vector store using mxbai-embed-large embeddings.
- Ask questions and get answers generated by Llama 3.1 (8B) locally.
- Cached vector store generation for fast re-runs.
- Chat-style interface with conversation history.
- Fully offline — no API keys needed.
